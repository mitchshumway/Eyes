# Eye Exercise

## Description and Roadmap

The goal of this challenge was to create two matching eyes that followed the users mouse around the the screen. I wanted to write a function that created additional eyes when the user clicks. As uploaded, clicking will upload one additional eye. I plan to keep working on it until clicking can create an unlimited amount of eyes.
